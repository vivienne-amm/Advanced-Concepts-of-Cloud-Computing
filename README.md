To run the code following steps need to be executed:

- Make sure you have a python3 executable on your machine. You will also need 3 python libraries - boto3, requests and python-dotenv. If you are missing them you can use command pip install -r main_req.txt to install them.
- Create an .env file with your AWS credentials. An example with the valid format can seen in the .env.example file.
- Use main.py to initialize python3 main.py UP, tear down python3 main.py DOWN, or run a workload on the architecture python3 main.py RUN.
